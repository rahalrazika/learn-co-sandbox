Hi! ðŸ‘‹

You've opened the IDE Sandbox, an environment that you can access on "readme" and "code-along" lessons in Learn. It's a great place to experiment with code! ðŸŽ‰

*IMPORTANT*
Saving varies by the type of work you are doing:
-- Most of the work you do in the Sandbox is automatically saved on your behalf to the `learn-co-sandbox` repository in your GitHub account. Please DO NOT touch this repository in GitHub. Doing so will affect your Sandbox experience, and potentially cause your work to fall out of sync.
-- *Git repositories that you clone into the Sandbox are NOT automatically saved.* In this case, you are responsible for committing and pushing your work to GitHub.
